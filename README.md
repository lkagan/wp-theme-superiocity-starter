#  Custom Theme
Developed by [Superiocity](http://www.superiocity.com)

## Build Process
This theme uses `npm` from [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to manage build tools.  Familiarity with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is required.

* `npm install` from within the theme root will install all the build tools required.
* `gulp` from within the theme root will run all the tools including transpiling sass to css and minifying javascript files.
* Source files such as \*.scss, \*.js and image files are located in the _src/_ directory.
* Images are automatically minified so make sure to put them in the _src/_ directory and they'll find their way to the correct images directory.
